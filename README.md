# Numerical-Methods-notes
This kind of notes written as an supplement material to the current course \textbf{Numerical methods } and can also acted as an \textbf{Review} of the next year's examination. The reason why i rewrite the notes lie at its reduced or shortened paragraphs for proofs, claims and its applications, which will causes starters confused about the arise of some specific definitions and its derives. So to solve these obstacles, a all new notes will contains \textit{Speculations, Constructions of proof and Extended reading material} all of those was to help strengthen the understanding of Numerical methods and its application. \\
\textbf{Don't be a idiot at proof and hero at application}
